**Base Path:** `/api/v1/users`

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| `/` | GET | ✅ PASS | List users working for admin |
| `/` (unauthorized) | GET | ⚠️ FAIL | Should be 403, got 200 (missing adminOnly middleware on some routes) |

| `/` (search) | GET | ✅ PASS | Search functionality working |
| `/` | POST | ✅ PASS | User creation working |
| `/` (non-admin) | POST | ⚠️ FAIL | Should be 403, got 201 (missing adminOnly middleware) |

## Issues Discovered

### Critical Issues
1. **Missing Authorization Middleware**
   - POST `/api/v1/users` allows regular users to create users
   - PUT `/api/v1/users/:id` allows regular users to update any user
   - Need to add `adminOnly` middleware to these routes

2. **Missing Endpoints**
   - PUT `/api/v1/users/:id/toggle-status` returns 404

### Minor Issues
1. **Pagination Inconsistency**
   - Response uses `page`, `limit`, `total`, `totalPages`
   - Tests expect `current_page`, `total_pages`
   - Recommend standardizing on one format

2. **Controller Coverage**
   - Many controllers have 0% test coverage
   - Comprehensive tests revealed potential issues but couldn't test deeply

---

## Endpoints Successfully Tested

1. POST `/api/v1/auth/register`
2. POST `/api/v1/auth/login`
3. POST `/api/v1/auth/refresh`

13. GET `/api/v1/mrfcs/:id`
14. GET `/` (root)
15. GET `/api/v1/health`
16. Error handling (404, 401)

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Add Missing Middleware**
   - Add `adminOnly` to POST `/api/v1/users`
   - Add `adminOnly` to PUT `/api/v1/users/:id`
   - Implement PUT `/api/v1/users/:id/toggle-status`

2. **Expand Test Coverage**
   - Create tests for remaining 38+ endpoints
   - Target: 80% overall code coverage
   - Focus on controllers with 0% coverage

3. **Fix Known Issues**
   - Standardize pagination response format
   - Review and fix failing comprehensive tests

### Medium Priority
1. **Improve Error Testing**
   - Test all error cases for each endpoint
   - Verify error messages and codes
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions

2. **Add Integration Tests**
   - Test complete workflows (e.g., create MRFC → add agenda → upload document)
   - Test authorization flows
   - Test data relationships

### Low Priority
1. **Performance Testing**
   - Test pagination with large datasets
   - Test search performance
   - Test concurrent requests

2. **Security Testing**
   - Test SQL injection prevention
   - Test XSS prevention
   - Test rate limiting

## Conclusion

**Status: FUNCTIONAL with issues** ⚠️

The backend API is functional for core operations (authentication, users, MRFCs) but requires:
1. Security fixes (add missing authorization middleware)
2. Implementation of missing endpoints
3. Comprehensive testing of remaining modules

**Strengths:**
- Authentication system fully tested and working (100%)
- Core user management working
- MRFC management partially working
- All models properly defined
- Good test infrastructure in place

**Weaknesses:**
- Many endpoints untested
- Missing authorization on some admin endpoints
- Some endpoints not implemented
- Low coverage on supporting modules

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix critical security issues (missing admin authorization)
2. Implement missing endpoints
3. Expand test coverage to remaining modules
4. Run full regression testing after fixes
