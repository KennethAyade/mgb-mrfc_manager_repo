```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File test-api.ps1
```

### 3️⃣ See the Results (20 seconds later)

## ✅ Pre-Test Checklist

Before running tests, verify:

- [ ] You're in the repository root folder (where you see README.md)
- [ ] Server is running: `npm run dev` (in another terminal)
- [ ] Server output shows "Server running on port 3000"
- [ ] You have internet connection (for database)

### Verify Server is Running
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "MGB MRFC Manager API is running"
}
```

## 🚀 Quick Start (Copy-Paste)

### Terminal 1 (Server)
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### Terminal 2 (Tests)
```powershell
# Windows - PowerShell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File test-api.ps1

# OR Windows - Command Prompt
test-api.bat

# OR Mac/Linux
bash test-api.sh
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Success ✅
```
✓ ALL TESTS PASSED!
Total Tests: 12
Passed: 12
Failed: 0
```

### Something Failed ❌
- Script shows which test failed
- Error message explains the problem

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Server is not running"
**Solution:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### "Cannot connect to database"
**Solution:**
- Check `.env` file has DATABASE_URL
- Check internet connection
- Check Neon credentials

### "Port 3000 already in use"
**Solution (Windows):**
```powershell
# Find process
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*node*"}

# Kill it
Stop-Process -Name node -Force
```

### "Invalid credentials / Login failed"
**Solution:**
- Make sure you used exact credentials:
  - Username: `superadmin`
  - Password: `Change@Me#2025`
- Check super admin was created in database

### "Tests passing but not all endpoints?"
**This is normal!** Only 10 endpoints are implemented:
- 5 authentication endpoints ✅
- 5 MRFC management endpoints ✅
- 6 user management endpoints ✅ (being tested now)

See IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md for progress.
