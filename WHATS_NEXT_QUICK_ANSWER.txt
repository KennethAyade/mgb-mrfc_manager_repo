   Result:    Full understanding before continuing

5. I IMPLEMENT EVERYTHING FOR YOU
   Action:    I build all remaining 36 endpoints
   Time:      8-12 hours non-stop (or 3-4 days)
   Result:    52/52 complete, backend done
   Status:    I can do this easily

================================================================================
 RECOMMENDED PATH: CONTINUE NOW (45 MINUTES)
================================================================================

WHY THIS?
  - Easy (just follow MRFC pattern)
  - Quick (45 minutes)
  - Essential (needed for Agenda)
  - Builds momentum
  - Gets you to 40% done

WHAT YOU'LL DO:
  1. Create proponent.controller.ts (copy from mrfc.controller.ts)
  2. Create proponent.routes.ts (copy from mrfc.routes.ts)
  3. Add to backend/src/routes/index.ts
  4. Test with test-working.ps1
  5. Update IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md

RESULT:
  - 5 new working endpoints
  - Tests passing
  - 40% completion
  - Ready for Quarter Management

 QUICK COMMANDS IF CONTINUING
================================================================================

# Make sure server is running
cd backend
npm run dev

# Create files (copy from MRFC pattern)
# File 1: backend/src/controllers/proponent.controller.ts
# File 2: backend/src/routes/proponent.routes.ts
# File 3: Update backend/src/routes/index.ts

# Test everything
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File test-working.ps1

# If tests pass, you're done with Proponent!
# Move to Quarter Management (20 minutes)

================================================================================
 THE BIG PICTURE
================================================================================

PROGRESS:
  31% done = 16 endpoints
  69% remaining = 36 endpoints

TIME TO COMPLETION:
  If you go hard:        8-12 hours â†’ All done today
  If you pace yourself:  3-4 days (2-3 hrs/day)
  If you go steady:      4+ weeks (3-5 hrs/week)

DIFFICULTY:
