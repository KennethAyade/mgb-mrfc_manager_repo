### Writing Effective Agenda Proposals

✅ **Good Example:**

**Title:** Purchase New Fire Extinguishers

❌ **Bad Example:**

**Title:** Fire stuff

**Description:** Need to buy things.

**Why it's bad:**
- Vague title
- No details
- No budget
- No explanation

### When to Use Voice Recordings

✅ **Use recordings for:**

❌ **Don't use recordings for:**
- Every single meeting (too much storage)
- Meetings with sensitive information
- Very short meetings
- Informal chats

💡 **Best Practice:** Record key discussions and decisions, not the entire meeting.

### Keeping Organized Notes

✅ **Tips:**
- Write notes during or right after the meeting
- Use clear titles like "Q2 Meeting - May 10 - Safety Discussion"
- Include date and topic
- Write main points as bullet points
- Note who said what
- Note any action items assigned to you

**Example:**
```
Title: Q2 Meeting - May 10 - Budget Review
Date: May 10, 2025
