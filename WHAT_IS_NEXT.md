## 🚀 If You Want to Continue Right Now

### Quickest Path: 1 Hour Effort = 7 More Endpoints

```
STEP 1 (10 min):  Create Proponent Controller
                  Copy from MRFC, change model name

STEP 2 (5 min):   Create Proponent Routes
                  Copy from MRFC, adjust paths

STEP 3 (5 min):   Add to index.ts
                  One line import and use

STEP 4 (15 min):  Test everything
                  Run test-working.ps1

STEP 5 (10 min):  Update docs
                  Mark 5/52 → 21/52 (40%)

STEP 6 (15 min):  Do Quarter endpoints (2)
                  Just list and get-current

STEP 7 (5 min):   Final test
                  Everything passing
```

**Result:** 21/52 endpoints (40%) - More than 1/3 done!

## 💻 Exact Commands If Continuing

```bash
# Step 1: Ensure server is running
cd backend
npm run dev

# Step 2: Open new terminal, create files
# (Copy code from NEXT_STEPS.md or MRFC controller)
# File 1: backend/src/controllers/proponent.controller.ts
# File 2: backend/src/routes/proponent.routes.ts
# File 3: Update backend/src/routes/index.ts

# Step 3: Test
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File test-working.ps1

# Step 4: If all green, you're done with Proponent!
# Ready for Quarter management next
```

## 🎉 Bottom Line

**The hard part is done.**

- Infrastructure: ✅
- Database: ✅
- Authentication: ✅
- Pattern: ✅
- Testing: ✅

**Now it's just repetition.**
